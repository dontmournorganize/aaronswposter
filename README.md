aaronswposter
=============

source material for aaron swartz poster for all resolutions.

These are the raw materials used for the poster: 

poster.svg contains the finished product which is where you can easily modify the text, export to larger resolutions etc. 

poster.xcf contains the base image converted to black and white which you should create a newsprint filtered version of for the specific resolution you are printing. 

web-news.png and full-news.png are the two sizes already embedded in the svg (hide the top layer to see the full sized version). 

ThomasPaine-Regular.ttf is the font used (it will need to be installed) to be consistent with aaronsw.com.

Don't drop the torch. Let this be the start of a whole new epoch of activism and pursuit of liberation!
